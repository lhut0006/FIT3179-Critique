                    <p style="text-align: left;">This visualisation depicts the number of global tweets containing
                        the
                        hashtags
                        #Biden and #Trump in the lead-up to and just after the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. Two key
                        events are marked: the Second Presidential Debate on October 22, 2020, and Election Day on
                        November 3, 2020.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left">
                        There is a notable spike in both hashtags following the Second Presidential Debate, where the
                        #Trump hashtag slightly leads in number of tweets. However, as the end of the election
                        approaches, the
                        #Biden
                        hashtag begins to surpass #Trump, with a significant increase around Election Day itself,
                        peaking at around 150,000 tweets.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: left">
                        This trend suggests that discussions about Biden gained more traction globally as the election
                        date neared, with tweet activity for both candidates increasing but #Biden gaining more
                        momentum as results were announced.

                        The word cloud visualises the most frequent words in tweets related to #Trump and #Biden,
                        highlighting the prominence of both political figures in public discourse. Larger words such as
                        "trump," "biden," "joebiden," and "realdonaldtrump" dominate the visualisation, indicating the
                        frequent mentions of these terms. Words like "election," "president," and "vote" suggest a focus
                        on the election and the broader political environment.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to English terms, there are a variety of words in other
                        languages like "es," "de," and "una," showing the international reach and engagement in
                        discussions surrounding these political figures. The overall focus clearly
                        revolves around the two key political figures, their campaigns, and related political events or
                        sentiments.</p>

                <div class="description description-left">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">The plot depicts user engagement by hour for tweets containing the
                        hashtags #Biden and #Trump. Each data point represents the average engagement levels throughout
                        the day, with the blue circles indicating #Biden tweets and the orange circles representing
                        #Trump tweets.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">The overall trend suggests that engagement levels for both hashtags
                        tend to fluctuate, with some peaks observed around certain hours. Notably, the engagement for
                        #Biden appears to be slightly higher during the early morning hours, while #Trump's engagement
                        is relatively consistent but slightly lower.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">A general trend of engagement around hours 15-18 is visible in the data
                        for #Biden, where these hours coincide with the candidate being elected, causing
                        a spike in engagement on Twitter around the globe.</p>

                            Sentiment</a>

                        analysis of tweets measures the emotions expressed in social media posts to understand
                        public opinion. By examining the language used, we can classify tweets as positive, negative, or
                        neutral. This helps us uncover how people feel about specific topics or events.

                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">From this graph, we can infer that tweets about Biden tend to
                        carry a more positive sentiment, whereas tweets about
                        Trump tend to have a more negative sentiment throughout the day. These insights suggest a
                        stark contrast in how users engaged with the two candidates on Twitter during the
                        presidential election. The sudden spike in sentiment for Biden around 3pm coincides with the
                        hours after the candidate was announced as president.

                        hashtags #Trump and #Biden on Twitter during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The colours
                        represent an

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Unsurprisingly, North America, particularly the United States and Canada, show the highest
                        levels of engagement. Other regions, such as Australia and parts of Europe, also demonstrate
                        significant interest in the election despite being geographically isolated from the
                        United States.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        In contrast, large areas in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia show minimal engagement,
                        highlighting how attention to the U.S. election varied globally with significant engagement from
                        specific English speaking regions.

                        In this visualisation, we’re looking at the sentiment associated with tweets that include the
                        hashtags #Biden and #Trump across various countries. Each country is represented along the
                        vertical axis, while the horizontal axis captures the sentiment values, indicating how positive
                        or negative the tweets are.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        You can see a clear contrast in sentiment for the two hashtags in many
                        countries. For instance, countries like Canada and Australia show a stronger positive sentiment
                        toward #Biden, with the blue bars reflecting a favorable view, while the orange bars for #Trump
                        tend to hover around neutrality or negativity.
                    </p>
                    On the other hand, India stands out with a notably negative sentiment for #Biden, suggesting a
                    different public perception there. Overall, this visualisatoin highlights the varied attitudes
                    toward these
                    political figures worldwide, revealing important insights into how sentiment can differ by region
                    and culture.
